        <p>The internet, and computer-facilitated world, had grown deeply embedded in people’s lives by 1999. According to a 1999 Pew research study, 62% of Americans were enjoying the abundance of information access. Computer concerns grew alongside this, with 54% concerned about a lack of digital privacy, for example. When a large part of the country’s population are using something so integral as computers, it makes sense that something like the Y2K bug would cause fear in the country.</p>
